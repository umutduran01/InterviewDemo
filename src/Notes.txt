3 Important Components of Cucumber;
    1) Feature File - We use Gherkin language in this file and write hte scenario.
    2) Step Definition - We write the code in this file.
    3) Test Runner - We execute the code.

    When we make any change in Features file, we need to change in Step Definitions file as well.

dryRun = true;
    It indicates that the operation will not have any real effect or impact on the system or environment, but will instead provide a preview so we can our missing codes there.

Commenting in feature file;
    We can use # to comment in feature file.

Tagging in Cucumber;
    When we want to tag some specific tests, we can add an annotation before scenario such as @smoke. To run this case, in TestRunner we add a new parameter such as tags = "@smoke".
    We can also execute multiple tags by using "or" : tags = "@test1 or @test2"
