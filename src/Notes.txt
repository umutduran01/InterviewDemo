3 Important Components of Cucumber;
    1) Feature File - We use Gherkin language in this file and write hte scenario.
    2) Step Definition - We write the code in this file.
    3) Test Runner - We execute the code.

    When we make any change in Features file, we need to change in Step Definitions file as well.

dryRun = true;
    It indicates that the operation will not have any real effect or impact on the system or environment, but will instead provide a preview so we can our missing codes there.
